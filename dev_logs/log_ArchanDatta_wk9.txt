This week I worked on starting to build a simulator for our app for the live demo, allowing us to feed
in some data to show that our app is functioning since NBA games are suspended. Also worked on
refactoring a team members code on the setting page and logic. Refactored some of the UI and code clean
up. Lastly as a group we created our video for the pitch of our app and worked on D4 document. ~20hours.
