Added polling system to fetch JSON data from the REST API every 3 seconds. When app is closed (still runs in the background)
scores are still being fetched and parsed, which allows us the ability to send notifications about games scores.
I also added a local SQLite database that will store user settings which include at what time the user would like to be notified, the score
differential when the user wants to be notified, and the users favourite team. - Took Approximately 5-6 hours to complete
