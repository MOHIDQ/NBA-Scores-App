-I tried implementing recyclerView and CardView to display the game cards for our app. The issues that I
faced were the package version not being compatible with the API level (which was later changed) and the
app stopping frequently while testing. We eventually decided not to move forward with recyclerView and to
rather stick with just cardView for our app.
