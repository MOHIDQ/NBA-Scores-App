Completed the implementation of a timer for the Splash Screen of our app. Which consisted of the modification of the following class:

- MainActivity.java
- took ~3hrs to complete

Currently working on making the splash screen exit out of its timer along with making the logo for our app dynamically adjustable for multiple
android devices.
