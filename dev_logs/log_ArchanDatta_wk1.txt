The application has the ability to run in the background and have a consistent notification showing
the user that the app is running. The notification is mapped to the settings page where is user will
be able to force stop the app. ~ 3 hours

This week I plan on creating a class which will allow for customized notifications and do further
research and testing on the app running in the background.
