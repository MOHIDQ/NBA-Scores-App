This week I updated the game card layout design/user interface to make it look more appealing. I added new styles for the game cards which included border colours(NBA colour scheme) and rounded cards for each game. I also uploaded our finished application for review to be published to the Google Play Store which required me to build an apk file, add app icons, and create a dashboard to showcase the application. Took approximately 5-6 hours to complete.
