-I researched different ways of how to best portray the user interface design of game cards that we
wanted to present on our home screen, similar to the game cards the are shown when you are following
scores on google. I found two support packages that I felt would be ideal for our idea; recyclerView
and cardView.

-I made rough designs for the game cards that we could use for our user interface and made alterations
after the feedback from the team
