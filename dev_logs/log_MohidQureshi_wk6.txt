I parsed the start match date to include only the time. I added extra functions to the databasehelper class to be able to 
return attributes from the database easier for those wanting to get those values, rather than doing the parsing 
each time the database is used. I also added a quarter count attribute to the SQLite database, which will represents
at which quarter the user wants to be notified at. - In total took approximately 3-4 hours.
