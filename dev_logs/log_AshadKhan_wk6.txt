I researched ways on how to have seperate activities for the splash screen and game cards in the app. The reason
for this was that we were facing an issue of the app going back to the splash screen when you pressed the back
button on your phone. We also wanted to look into how we can have the app load in the background while the
splash screen is displaying so there is no delay when the game cards show up. ~4 hours
