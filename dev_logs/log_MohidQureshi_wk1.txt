Application has ability to access rest api via get http request and gets readable JSON data back that contain all the current games being
played today, and live updates for those games. - approximately took 3 hours to complete

This week I plan on parsing the JSON data into Game java objects which will make it much easier to work with when creating
the user interface. I also plan on researching more about the REST API and its return types for each end point for cases such
as when a game goes into multiple overtime and how to handle those cases. - should approximately take 3-4 hours to complete.
